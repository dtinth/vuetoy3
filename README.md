# vuetoy3

**vuetoy3** is a minimalistic boilerplate for quickly building web applications based on Vue 3.
It does not require any build tool or development server.
Ideal for building side-projects, where you:

- want multiple routes (it comes with Vue Router)
- prefer not to use any build tool
- donâ€™t need to support older browsers
- want IntelliSense in your editor (it comes with a typings file)
